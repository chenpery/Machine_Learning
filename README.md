# Major Homework Projects – Machine Learning Course

This repository contains both wet and dry parts of a major multi-part assignment for the Machine Learning course 02360756 .

## wet/ – Programming Assignments

The `wet/` directory contains the full code and reports for the hands-on (programming) parts of the assignment.

### Part 1 – Data Preparation

| File                             | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `Major_HW1_-_Data_preparation.pdf` | Instructions for Part 1 |
| `GalAndChenHw1_final.pdf`         | Final submitted report for Part 1 |

Part 1 focuses on data loading, cleaning, one-hot encoding, feature selection, and creating training-validation splits.

###  Part 2 – Model Selection

| File                             | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `Major_HW2_-_Model_Selection.pdf` | Instructions for Part 2 |
| `part2_sol.pdf`                  | Written solution including evaluations and comparisons |
In Part 2, different models (ridge, lasso, etc.) are evaluated and compared based on validation performance. The best model is selected and justified.

### Part 3 – Regression & Theory
| File                             | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `Major_HW3_-_Regression.pdf`     | Instructions for Part 3 |
| `report.pdf`     | report for Part 3 |
Part 3 explores regression using Huber loss, theory questions about generalization, VC-dimension, and convexity.

## Dry Reports (not in `wet/`)

These are separate **theoretical assignments** .  

| File                             | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| `part1_sol.pdf`                  | includes derivations and explanations on data preprocessing, encoding strategies, and train-validation split methods. |
| `part2_sol.pdf`                  | discusses model selection criteria, overfitting, validation techniques, and justifications for choosing specific models. |
| `SVM_and_PAC_and_Optimization.pdf` | Support Vector Machines (SVM), Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning theory, and convex optimization principles. |
